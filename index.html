<h2 id="personal-profile"><strong>Personal Profile</strong></h2>

<p>Through a variety of academic, business, and pastoral roles, I have been fortunate enough to gain a well-rounded, dynamic, and forward-thinking view into what makes a valuable and successful business. Responsibility is a feature I have always excelled in managing, and paired with my reliability, I have been trusted to take initiative and leadership in both professional and personal environments. I strive to become an asset to any new team, both socially and professionally, and pride myself on my problem-solving and flexibility. After graduating from the University of Bristol with a degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, I am now applying my skills in logical reasoning, data analysis, and communication, to pursue a career in Business Development, Events, and Media.</p>

<p>I am currently working as a Business Development Executive within the Events and Business Development Team at the University of Bristol Students’ Union. Here I am responsible for liaising with a variety of large businesses to organise brand activations, digital marketing, and client contracts as a primary account manager.
I also work with SMEs across the city, providing support and advice on how to engage the 26,000 students currently studying at the University.</p>

<p>This year my team organised two of the biggest events of my portfolio - the University of Bristol Official Welcome Fair in October 2020 and the Refreshers Fair in January 2021. In the period leading up to these 8,000+ attendee digital events, I created B2B marketing campaigns, produced an extensive media pack, and onboarded over 55 commercial partners.</p>

<p>Acting as a Senior Resident for the University of Bristol, I was responsible for ensuring the pastoral care and wellbeing of incoming first-year students moving into halls of residence. Although challenging in nature, I thoroughly enjoyed taking on this responsibility and it enabled me to develop several new skills while pushing myself to be a well rounded, professional, and supportive individual. I was responsible for administration, support, and daily operation of the halls of residence, as well as organising events and providing pastoral talks to large numbers of students.</p>
